# sendlightLD382
This is a little weekend-project webinterface to control lamps and lights powered by a LD382 chip. this chip is mostly found in e.g. Magic Home products.

# How to use?
Well, put it on a server with php-scripting abilities and open the config.inc.php. There put all your desired information and you are ready to go!

# I found a bug.
Good for you. File a report. Maybe I'll fix it. Maybe.

# For what is the doc folder?
I've put a pdf inside, containing a website with all the information about the LD382 chip, which I've used for this...
